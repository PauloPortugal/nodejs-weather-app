# A Nodejs Weather App
An event-driven assyncronous Node.js Weather app, to explore Node.js' assyncronous non-blocking single-threaded event-loop.

The user provides the location and the application returns a forecast for that same location.

This is part of Andrew Mead's (mead.io) "The Complete Node.js Developer Course".

* Uses mapbox.com for forward geocoding
* Uses darksky.net to return the weather forecast for a given town/place.
