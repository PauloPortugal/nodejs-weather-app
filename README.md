# A Nodejs Weather App
An event-driven asynchronous Node.js Weather app, to explore Node.js' asynchronous non-blocking single-threaded event-loop.
This is part of Andrew Mead's (mead.io) "The Complete Node.js Developer Course".

## Goal
Return a weather forecast based on user's input location

* Uses [mapbox.com] for forward geocoding
* Uses [darksky.net] to return the weather forecast for a given town/place.
* Uses `ECMAScript6` Object Property Shorthand and Destructuring
